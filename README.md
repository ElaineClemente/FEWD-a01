I am a *graphic designer*. Since I was 17, I have been working in my father’s printing company in Brazil. By that time, in the 1990’s, printing technology hit the big time and the invention of the modern printing press made amazing changes. The company faced an important moment of change with high investments.

I remember being fascinated watching how the printing process works. It is fantastic the way that a printing machine reproduce images and texts transferring inks to the paper. I was attracted to design not just for the pretty colors but for everything that goes on behind the scenes in this industry. Since then, I had no doubts that I wanted to work as a graphic designer.

Now, I took this opportunity to have a new experience and improve my career with this Front End Web Designer course. I am fascinated how fast I can see my designers running in the websites. Each class of this course brings me a new perspective about what I can do with the **Internet Universe**. It is amazing!
